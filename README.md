  ## Description
  In this assignment, we were asked to create a REACT Portfolio to showcase the different apps we have made throughout the course to potential employers. Using REACT allows us to create a much more dynamic portfolio, but also requires us to break up the components of our site into different files. I think this assignment was a great way to learn REACT, and now I have a site that shows I know how to use it. Looking forward to building more with REACT in the future as I learn more about it.
